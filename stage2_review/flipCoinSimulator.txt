Step1:
we had assign two variable head and tail with 0 value in it

Step 2: 
Then we had while loop and condition for while loop is 
head -lt 21 && tail -lt 21

Step 3:
Inside while loop we had Random value assign to Result variable in %2 
means only 0,1 value will be iterated.
then we had echo $Result to print the value

Step 4:
Then we had If Else statement:
  if [`expr $Result == 0`]
    then
      head=$(($head+1))
    else
      tail=$(($tail+1))
fi

Step 5:
When we come out of the while loop 
echo "heads count win" $head
echo "tails count win" $tail
