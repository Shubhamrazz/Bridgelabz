**********ALGORITHM**********
Step 1
first have taken/generated three user input from the terminal a , b , c.
like:
     read -p "Enter the first number": a
     read -p "Enter the second number": b
     read -p "Enter the third number": C

Step 2
secondly we have made four variable named as: UC2,UC3,UC4,UC5

Step 3
thirdly we had assing all the four airthmatic operation inside respective variable.
like:
    UC2=$(($a+$b*$c))
    UC3=$(($a*$b+$c))
    UC4=$(($c+$a/$b))
    UC5=$(($a%$b+$c))

Step 4
forthly we are printing all airthmatic exprestion which has taken place inside respective
variable.
like:
    echo"Second : $UC2";
    " 
    "
    "
    echo"fifth : $UC5":

Step 5
Then we had declared a dictionary
like:
     decclare -A airthmatics

Step 6
Then we had assign the values inside respective key of dictionary

Step 7
Then read into array
like:
     echo "Read all the results : ${airthmatics[@]}"

Step 8
Sort the array in assending and decending order
